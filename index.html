                        This influence on human society has given them the sobriquet of "man's best friend.

                <li class="h3">Where did dogs originate?</li>
                <p>
                    We know dogs evolved from wolves, and researchers
                    and geneticists have extensively studied canines to try and pin
                    down the exact moment in history when the first dog walked the Earth.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Archaeological evidence and DNA analysis make the Bonn-Oberkassel dog the first undisputed example of a dog.
                    The remains, a right mandible (jaw), were discovered during basalt quarrying in Oberkassel, Germany in 1914.
                    First mistakenly classified as a wolf, the Bonn-Oberkassel dog was buried with two humans around 14,220 years ago.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additional evidence suggests that around 15,000 years ago,
                    early dogs moved out of Southern and Central Asia and dispersed around the world, following humans as they migrated.
                </p>
                <li class="h3">The origins of the human-canine bond</li>
                <p>
                    The bond between humans and dogs have been extensively studied due to its unique nature.
                    This special relationship can be traced all the way back to when humans first started living in groups.
                </p>
                <p>
                    An early domestication theory suggests that the symbiotic,
                    mutualistic relationship between the two species started when
                    humans moved into colder Eurasian regions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Paleolithic dogs first began to appear at the same time, developing shorter skulls and wider braincases and snouts compared to their wolf ancestors.
                    The shorter snout eventually led to fewer teeth, which may have been the result of humans’ attempts to breed aggression out of dogs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ancestors of the modern dog enjoyed plenty of benefits from living around humans, including
                    improved safety, a steady supply of food, and more chances to breed.
                    Humans, with their upright gait and better color vision, also helped in spotting predators and prey over a larger range.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It has been hypothesized that humans in the early Holocene era,
                    around 10,000 years ago, would have chosen wolf puppies for behaviors like tameness and friendliness towards people.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These puppies grew to be hunting companions, tracking and and retrieving
                    wounded game as their human packs settled in Europe and Asia during the last Ice Age.
                    The dog’s heightened sense of smell greatly assisted in the hunt, too.
                </p>
                <li class="h3">The Development of Different Dog Breeds</li>
                <p>
                    Humans have been selectively breeding dogs to emphasize favorable characteristics like size, herding abilities,
                    and strong scent detection for many years. Hunter-gatherers, for instance, chose wolf puppies that displayed
                    reduced aggression towards people. With the
                    dawn of agriculture came herding and guard dogs who were bred to protect farms and flocks and capable of digesting a starchy diet.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Distinct dog breeds don’t appear to have been identified until 3,000 to 4,000 years ago,
                    but the majority of the dog types we have today had been established by the Roman period.
                    Understandably, the oldest dogs were most likely working dogs that used to hunt, herd, and guard.
                    Dogs were interbred to enhance speed and strength and enhance senses like sight and hearing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sight hounds like the Saluki had heightened hearing or sharper sight that allowed them to track down and chase prey.
                    Mastiff-type dogs were valued for their large, muscular bodies, which made them better hunters and guardians.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Artificial selection throughout millenia greatly diversified the world’s population of dogs and resulted in
                    the development of various dog breeds, with each breed sharing uniform observable traits such as size and behavior.
                </p>
                <li class="h3">Conclusion</li>
                <p>
                    Dogs have certainly come a long way from scavenging around early human tribes,
                    and dogs’ natural history is something that continues to be extensively studied by scholars around the world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Recent genetic studies presume the dog’s direct ancestors to be extinct,
                    making it more difficult to draw definitive conclusions about the origin of the canine species.
                    Many theories also exist about the history of the dog’s domestication,
                    with one popular theory being that two groups of dog-like animals were domesticated in separate places at different times.
